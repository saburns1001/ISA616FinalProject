##Dr. Farmer's Final Project
In this repository and with this project, we will perform a variety of analyses that will be needed to complete full report for Dr. Farmer. The specific information of our apprach is given:
## Problem Statement and Overview
Our problem is that the FSB IS and BA Departments have information stored in a way that is hard to verify. Currently, the way to organize and track student classes (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.) is inconsistent, which leads to confusion when trying to count them. Because of this, there seems to be a disproportionate number of seniors compared to those who graduate in that same year. Our goal is to reorganize the data to develop an easier and more informative way to present and analyze it. 

## Research Questions
* What student success metric can be tracked or analyzed to provide a functional definition of a studentâ€™s academic standing in both the IS and BA departments?
* What student success metrics can be used to establish a procedure to accurately count student graduates each semester for the IS and BA departments?
* How can the data table elements be cleaned and combined to add clarity to the content of the student success data and allow for our analyses to be easily reproduced?
